<objective>
Deploy the application to GitHub Pages and verify all Phase 1 requirements are met on the live deployment.

Purpose: Fulfills TECH-03 (GitHub Pages deployable) and provides verification that the app works in production.
Output: Live, publicly accessible URL where the educational app can be accessed.

  <name>Task 1: Prepare repository and deploy to GitHub Pages</name>
  <files></files>
  <action>
    Verify repository setup:
    - Confirm .nojekyll file exists in root (created in 01-01)
    - Confirm all source files are committed
    - Confirm index.html is in root (GitHub Pages requirement)

    Deploy to GitHub Pages via GitHub CLI:
    - Use `gh repo view --web` to confirm repository exists
    - If not a GitHub repo yet, use `gh repo create` to create one
    - Push all code to main/master branch
    - Enable GitHub Pages: `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pages -X POST -f source='{"branch":"main","path":"/"}'`
    - Or use GitHub web UI: Settings -> Pages -> Source: Deploy from branch (main, root)

    Alternative if gh CLI fails:
    - Go to repository Settings -> Pages
    - Select "Deploy from a branch"
    - Choose main branch, / (root) folder
    - Save and wait for deployment

    Get deployment URL:
    - Format: https://{username}.github.io/{repo-name}/
    - Check deployment status: `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pages`
    - Wait for deployment to complete (usually 1-2 minutes)

    Note: First deployment may take up to 10 minutes. Subsequent deployments are faster.
  </action>
  <verify>
    - Run `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pages` - status should show "built"
    - Open the GitHub Pages URL in browser
    - Page loads without 404 error
    - No console errors in browser dev tools

    GitHub Pages deployment is active and accessible via public URL

  <what-built>
    Complete Phase 1 foundation deployed to GitHub Pages:
    - Static web app with HTML, CSS, JavaScript
    - Hash-based routing for navigation
    - Home page with 7 lesson cards in responsive grid
    - Navigation with forward/back buttons (48x48px touch targets)
    - Progress indicator on every page
    - LocalStorage state management (no personal data)
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
    Open the GitHub Pages URL and verify:

    1. **Home Page (NAV-04)**
       - See "KI und ich" title
       - See all 7 lesson cards visible at once
       - Cards show German lesson titles

    2. **Navigation (NAV-01)**
       - Click any lesson card - navigates to lesson view
       - See "Zurueck" and "Weiter" buttons at bottom
       - Buttons are large and easy to tap (48x48px)
       - Click through: Home -> Lesson 1 -> Quiz 1 -> Lesson 2 -> etc.

    3. **Progress Indicator (NAV-02)**
       - See "Schritt X von 7" on every lesson/quiz page
       - Progress updates as you navigate

    4. **Mobile Responsive (NAV-03)**
       - Open browser dev tools (F12)
       - Toggle device toolbar (Ctrl+Shift+M)
       - Select "iPad" or tablet preset
       - Verify layout adapts (cards stack/reflow)
       - Select mobile preset (iPhone)
       - Verify still usable on narrow screen

    5. **Touch Targets (NAV-05)**
       - In dev tools, inspect navigation buttons
       - Verify min-width and min-height are >= 48px

    6. **DSGVO Compliance (TECH-04)**
       - Open dev tools -> Application -> Local Storage
       - See 'ki-und-ich-state' key
       - Verify value contains only app state (no names, emails, identifiers)

    7. **Technical Requirements**
       - TECH-01: App runs as static files (no server errors)
       - TECH-02: No backend calls (check Network tab - only static files)
       - TECH-03: Deployed on GitHub Pages (URL confirms)
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>
    Type "approved" if all Phase 1 requirements are met.
    If issues found, describe what needs fixing.
