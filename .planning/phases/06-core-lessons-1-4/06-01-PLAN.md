# Plan 06-01: Core Lessons 1-4 Content

**Phase**: 06-core-lessons-1-4
**Plan**: 06-01
**Objective**: Create educational content for Lessons 1-4 covering AI fundamentals, types, capabilities, and everyday applications

## Context

Phase 6 builds the foundational educational content that introduces children (ages 5-11) to AI concepts. These first four lessons establish core understanding before advancing to prompting techniques and building mini-apps in later phases.

**What exists**:
- Lesson framework from Phase 3 (LessonRenderer, screen types)
- Quiz system from Phase 4 (QuizRenderer, feedback animations)
- Progress tracking from Phase 5 (completion badges, confetti)
- Kiki mascot integration with emotions and speech

**What's needed**:
- JSON content for Lessons 1-4
- Corresponding quiz questions for each lesson
- Child-appropriate language (ages 7+)
- Alignment with pedagogical goals from PROJECT.md

## Success Criteria

**From ROADMAP.md Phase 6**:
1. User can complete Lesson 1 "Was ist KI?" with text and illustrations
2. User can complete Lesson 2 "KI-Arten" learning about LLM, LAM etc. in child-friendly terms
3. User can complete Lesson 3 "Was kann KI heute?" understanding current AI capabilities
4. User can complete Lesson 4 "KI im Alltag" recognizing practical AI applications
5. Each lesson has accompanying quiz that reinforces learning

### Task 3: Lesson 3 - "Was kann KI heute?" (Current Capabilities)

**File**: `src/data/lessons/lesson-3.json`

**Content structure**:
- Intro: AI's impressive current abilities
- Explanation: AI as helper (doctors, autonomous cars, translators)
- Explanation: AI in games (smart opponents, procedural generation)
- Explanation: Machine learning - AI that teaches itself
- Summary: AI's broad capabilities today

**Kiki integration**: Surprised opener → Happy about helpers → Curious about games → Thoughtful about learning → Proud summary

**Quiz**: `src/data/quizzes/quiz-3.json`
- Medical AI applications
- Gaming AI roles
- Machine learning concept
- Continuous improvement through practice
- Autonomous vehicles

### Task 4: Lesson 4 - "KI im Alltag" (AI in Daily Life)

**File**: `src/data/lessons/lesson-4.json`

**Content structure**:
- Intro: AI is everywhere (often hidden)
- Explanation: AI on phones (face unlock, typing suggestions, filters)
- Explanation: AI in entertainment (Netflix, YouTube, Spotify recommendations)
- Explanation: AI at home (smart assistants, robot vacuums, smart thermostats)
- Summary: Recognition of AI in everyday technology

**Kiki integration**: Surprised that AI is everywhere → Happy about phones → Curious about entertainment → Thoughtful about home → Proud summary

**Quiz**: `src/data/quizzes/quiz-4.json`
- Face recognition on phones
- Recommendation systems (Netflix, Spotify)
- Robot vacuum navigation
- Music suggestions
- Typing predictions

### Task 5: Content Verification

**Language appropriateness**:
- ✓ Short sentences (max 15-20 words)
- ✓ Simple vocabulary (7-year-old level)
- ✓ Active voice, direct address
- ✓ Avoid jargon; explain technical terms

**Educational alignment**:
- ✓ Verstehen → Anwenden → Reflektieren progression
- ✓ Growth mindset language ("Du kannst...")
- ✓ Curiosity-driven discovery
- ✓ Real-world relevance

**Screen count**:
- ✓ 5 screens per lesson (10-15 min completion time)
- ✓ Intro → Explanations → Summary structure
- ✓ Kiki emotion/message on every screen

**Quiz alignment**:
- ✓ 5 questions per lesson
- ✓ Questions directly reinforce lesson content
- ✓ Positive feedback language
- ✓ Encouraging corrections (not punitive)

## Technical Specifications

**Lesson JSON schema** (established in Phase 3):
```json
{
  "id": number,
  "title": string,
  "description": string,
  "screens": [
    {
      "type": "intro" | "explanation" | "example" | "interactive" | "summary",
      "content": { ... },
      "kikiEmotion": "happy" | "thoughtful" | "proud" | "sad" | "surprised" | "curious",
      "kikiMessage": string
    }
  ]
}
```

**Quiz JSON schema** (established in Phase 4):
```json
{
  "lessonId": number,
  "title": string,
  "questions": [
    {
      "question": string,
      "answers": [string, string, string, string],
      "correctIndex": number,
      "feedback": {
        "correct": string,
        "incorrect": string
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Dependencies

**Requires**:
- Phase 3 complete: LessonRenderer, lesson-screen.js, lesson.css
- Phase 4 complete: QuizRenderer, quiz feedback system
- Phase 5 complete: Progress tracking, confetti on quiz success

**No code changes needed**: This plan only creates JSON content files.

## Pedagogical Notes

**AI Leadership principle**: Each lesson reinforces that humans control and direct AI
- Lesson 1: "Du kannst KI sagen, was sie tun soll"
- Lesson 2: "Verschiedene KI-Helfer für verschiedene Aufgaben"
- Lesson 3: "KI macht, was Menschen ihr beibringen"
- Lesson 4: "KI hilft dir - du entscheidest"

**Progression logic**:
1. **What** is AI? (Foundation understanding)
2. **Which types** exist? (Categorization)
3. **What can** it do? (Capabilities)
4. **Where** is it? (Recognition in daily life)

This sets up Lessons 5-6 (prompting techniques) and Lesson 7 (building with AI).
